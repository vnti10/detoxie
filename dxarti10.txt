Hard water shampoo to make your hair smile
Water with very high mineral content is considered as hard water, which contains deposits of calcium carbonates, calcium bicarbonates, magnesium carbonates, magnesium bicarbonates, and sulphates. Hard water is a problem in many ways, one of which is dissolving the soap or soap-based products like shampoo. It prevents the soap from getting dissolved and as a result, shampoos and other soap-based products often fail to show their best results. The calcium and magnesium ions present in the hard water reacts with the soap and makes it difficult to rinse off and also prevents its mode of action. Therefore, if your locality gets a supply of hard water, you need to choose your soaps and shampoos effectively, so that it can work. Some extra components needed to be added in a soap or soap-based products like shampoo, so that it can dissolve and lather better in hard water and can function properly. Use of hard water also effects your hair, making it dry, and brittle, by mineral build up in the skin, which is harmful for the scalp also. So, a hard water specific shampoo must also contain compounds that helps to heal the hair and make it healthy.
Hard water shampoos contains chelator molecules which help in chelating the metal ions present in the hard water, thereby making them soluble and easily washable, and preventing their build up in the scalp. Clarifying shampoos help in removal of residues from the hard water which otherwise causes damage to the hair.
