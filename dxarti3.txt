Anti-pollution day cream: Fight against the pollution
Pollution is one of the most burning problems, which needs to be solved for the betterment of our planet. Pollution adversely affects the humankind in a very broad manner, affecting the health and livelihood. One of the most potent effect of pollution is on human skin, impacting the skin, as well as overall health. Many of the pollutants are either absorbed or adsorbed by the skin, which can potentially cause several illnesses.  In the daytime, a major threat to the human skin is the sun rays, which, if exposed for an adequate amount of time, can cause major health issues. Not only these rays, but there are also many atmospheric components which causes damage to our skin. Absorption of these rays and molecules by human skin needs to be stopped and for that, use of anti-pollution day cream is highly recommended by Detoxie.
One of the main effects of these pollutants is production of many reactive oxygen species (ROS) and also reactive nitrogen species (RNS) which are bad for the body. These reactive oxidative compounds need to be encountered by the antioxidants, which are present in the anti-pollution creams. These creams also create an extra layer above the skin which helps in reflecting back the rays from sunlight, instead of absorbing or adsorbing them.
The anti-pollution day cream is the shield to protect against the harmful pollutants, which can be considered as the enemies to the kingdom of our health. There are so many products available in the market which claims to have anti-pollution effects, but one needs to be sure before applying one.
